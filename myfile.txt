In Wikipedia and other MediaWiki projects, Special:Random can be used to access a random article in the main namespace; this feature is useful as a starting point for browsing Wikipedia, playing the Wikipedia game, or if you just want to learn a new interesting piece of information.

Depending on your browser, it's also possible to load a random page using a keyboard shortcut (in Firefox, Edge, and Chrome Alt-Shift+X).

To create a link to a random page in a different namespace, use [[Special:Random/Namespace]].

For example, Special:Random/Talk will take you to a random article's talk page.
